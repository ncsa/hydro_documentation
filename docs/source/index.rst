Introduction
======================

The Hydro HPC system provides highly productive resources and services for computational and 
data-intensive science. It is designed for maximum throughput on large-scale, complex applications 
using InfiniBand interconnect architecture. Hydro consists of 70 server nodes with a mix of AMD 
and Intel CPUs, and 18 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, 6 PB of online storage and 430 Gbps in external 
networking capability. The architectural balance makes Hydro capable of supporting an extremely 
wide range of science disciplines and uses, from at scale simulation and modeling to the most 
advanced approaches to Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. Hydro supports a current Linux base 
software stack and programming environment.

Who is eligible to request a allocation on Hydro?
---------------------------------------------------
Hydro allocations are limited to Illinois Computes and NFI projects. Please see the 
`NCSA Services - Hydro <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/FIN/Hydro>`_ page for additional 
information on non-NFI funded access to the Hydro cluster.


Getting Started with High-Performance Computing
=================================================

**There are no specific prerequisite courses or high-performance computing (HPC) experience required before using Hydro**. However, if you are unfamiliar with using an HPC cluster, it is highly recommended that you take NCSA’s short tutorial `Using an HPC Cluster for Scientific Applications <https://www.hpc-training.org/moodle/course/view.php?id=71>`_ before continuing.

Browse NCSA’s `HPC-Moodle <https://www.hpc-training.org>`_ for a full list of HPC training opportunities including self-paced tutorials and training events (in-person and virtual).
