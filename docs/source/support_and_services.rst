Support and Services
======================
This page lists topics we have specific infrastructure on the system to support.  If you have any further questions about these topics please submit a ticket (:ref:`help`).  

General Support
------------------

Intellectual services are available to stakeholders of Hydro on a limited basis from NFI and NCSA staff. Traditional service requests for assistance on  accessing and allocation issues, porting codes, debugging, and software requests are handled through the ticket system by sending email to (:ref:`help`).
Issues will be reviewed for estimated level of effort and scope of the request (impacts only one user, impacts an entire group, or impacts broader community). 

Requests requiring deeper engagement will need additional review and potentially funded work. Examples of such requests would be implementation of new algorithms or existing algorithms in a new language (e.g. from Matlab to Python), performance profiling and tuning. Please open a ticket to initiate a conversation.
