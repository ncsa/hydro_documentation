Account and Allocation Managment
======================================

Who is eligible to request a allocation on Hydro?
--------------------------------------------------
Hydro allocations are limited to Illinois Computes and NFI projects. Please see the 
`NCSA Services - Hydro <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/FIN/Hydro>`_ page for additional 
information on non-NFI funded access to the Hydro cluster. If you are part of an allocated NFI 
project and would like access to the Hydro cluster, please :ref:`submit a support request <help>` 
with a justification for your need to use the cluster.

Illinois Computes Participation
--------------------------------
Illinois Computes projects can be granted access to the Hydro system by selecting it as their 
desired resource when submitting a request to the Illinois Computes program. Please see 
`Illinois computes <https://www.computes.illinois.edu/submitrequest/>`_ for more information 
on submitting a request.

Adding Users to Your Allocation
--------------------------------
PIs can add and remove users from their allocation using the `NCSA group management interface
<https://internal.ncsa.illinois.edu/mis/groups/>`_. PIs can delegate the ability to manage users 
to other project members once those accounts are added to the project. Please refer to `NCSA documentation
<https://docs.ncsa.illinois.edu/en/latest/account-mgmt/group-mgmt.html#group-mgmt>`_
for additional help with the group management interface. 

.. Note::
    Group membership changes may take up to **15 minutes** to synchronize the changes with Hydro.

NCSA Account Managment
------------------------
You can manage your NCSA identity (change email, password, Duo device, etc) through the
`NCSA Identity and group management tools <https://docs.ncsa.illinois.edu/en/latest/account-mgmt/identity-mgmt.html>`_.

Each Hydro user will be a member of at least one allocated project which will map
to a group on the Hydro system.


NCSA Duo setup
----------------
For instructions on how to activate your NCSA Duo account, see `Duo at NCSA <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/cybersec/Duo+at+NCSA>`_. 
To check if your NCSA Duo is working properly, log into the `NCSA Duo portal <https://duo.security.ncsa.illinois.edu/portal>`_ and choose an authentication method.
