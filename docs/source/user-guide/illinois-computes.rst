Illinois Computes Specifics
----------------------------

Job Accounting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Illinois Compute projects are awarded Hydro compute time in units of node-hours. As jobs complete, a charge is subtracted from the project compute time balance. 

To see a project's balance and remaining compute time, use the ``accounts-remaining`` command. See the :ref:`project-job-accounting` section for more information.
