Support and Services
======================

This page lists topics we have specific infrastructure on the system to support. If you have any questions about these topics, please submit a support reqeust (:ref:`help`).  

General Support
------------------

Intellectual services are available to stakeholders of Hydro on a limited basis from NFI and NCSA staff. Traditional service requests for assistance on accessing and allocation issues, porting codes, debugging, and software requests are handled through the ticket system by submitting a support request (:ref:`help`).
Issues will be reviewed for estimated level of effort and scope of the request (impacts only one user, impacts an entire group, or impacts broader community). 

Requests requiring deeper engagement will need additional review and potentially funded work. Examples of such requests would be implementation of new algorithms or existing algorithms in a new language (e.g. from Matlab to Python), performance profiling, and tuning. Please submit a support request to initiate a conversation (:ref:`help`). 

Machine Learning
--------------------

Additional support is available for Hydro stakeholders on the topics of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). The Hydro programming environment provides access to common ML/DL frameworks by way of vendor provided containers from NVIDIA NGC or AMD Infinity Hub, from Anaconda Python, or from generic Python installations. Please open a ticket if you have questions about or are in need of assistance with software configurations or software installations (:ref:`help`). 

Similar to General Support, requests requiring deeper engagement will need additional review and potentially funded work. Examples of such requests would be development or implementation of new models and methodologies, optimization of distributed training, and development of large training datasets. Please submit a support request to initiate a conversation (:ref:`help`). 

Geospatial
------------

Basic support for CyberGIS or Geospatial HPC is available to Hydro stakeholders. Common software packages such as GDAL, geopandas, torchgeo, and others will be available as part of the Hydro software stack. Assistance with management of common, large data sets is also available. Please submit a support request if you have questions about or are in need of assistance with Geospatial workloads or datasets (:ref:`help`).
