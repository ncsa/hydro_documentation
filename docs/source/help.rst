   <p>The <a href="http://help.ncsa.illinois.edu">NCSA Help Portal</a> is the preferred method to submit requests. However, if you run into problems using it, you can still email <a href="mailto:help@ncsa.illinois.edu?subject=Hydro: ">help@ncsa.illinois.edu</a> for support.</p>

**To help NCSA staff efficiently address your request, in your initial email, please include:**

- A descriptive subject line starting with **Hydro** (for example, "Hydro: Permission denied error loading blorg module")
- In the email body, include:
  
  - The UserID you use to log into the system.
  - Approximately when (date/time) the issue occurred.
  - What you were trying to do and how you tried to do it.
  - Why you think it isn’t working.
  - Commands or scripts you ran, in enough detail to reproduce the problem (text files are preferred).
  - The output and/or error messages you got (text files are preferred).
  - Did you install any modules? If so, which ones? (run ``module list`` and paste the output into the message)
  - If your command or script worked in the past, when did it stop working?
  - Any other approaches you’ve tried.
  - Any other information you think might be relevant.

**If you have multiple, unrelated issues, please create a separate ticket for each by sending separate emails.**

You will receive email correspondence as your ticket is worked on, please respond to any questions that are asked.
